<!-- TO DO FOR THE REST OF THIS: 

-Center this grid, add another button for reset, add a message section
-write the initialization function that would reset everything - basically just put the arrays back to 0 and the buttons back to empty when that one button is hit
-get the console.log messages to appear on that text area instead
-maybe instead of a reset button its a "next game" and you keep a running tally of who has won and how many in the top corner, could add streaks too 
-add stats if you click on a button for average number of moves it takes the player vs the computer - you'll need to have different counters for player vs. computer move then
that last thing might be hard based on how you've set it up but you can try
